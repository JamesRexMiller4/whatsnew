# Whats New - Solo Project MOD 3

## Overview: 
This project introduced us to the React library teaching us how to create components using JSX and using the built in React
render method to append the components to the DOM. The Whats New web app is a React app that displays news articles of various categories. 
A user is able to select on a tab that will filter the news articles according to the category selected. A user is also able to search for a
particular news article by typing into a search bar and submitting a search query. 

## Objectives: 

- Familiarize ourselves with React, Jest, and Enzyme 
- Learn to pass information through components via state and props
- Write unit tests for all components and methods and write DRY code

Technologies Used: 

React, Jest/Enzyme


## Issues / Future Iterations: 

Ran into some issues trying to test a method that reset the input field after a search query was submited, an issue ticket has been opened.
Plan to go back and redesign the CSS, and implement Sass and a more fluid user experience. 
Also plan to implement fetch requests to receive in data rather than have it saved in the source code
